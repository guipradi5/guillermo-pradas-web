Personal Website built in Next JS / React Framework on Node. It was designed to kinda function like an old computer. It has functioning windows, buttons, blog posts fetching, etc. It also displays projects I've worked on and contact information.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
