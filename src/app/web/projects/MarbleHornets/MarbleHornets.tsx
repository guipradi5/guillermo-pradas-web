        During university, I spent too much time on one specific assignment, this was that assignment.
        <br/><br/>
        This is an unofficial website I made for my favorite webseries, "Marble Hornets". It includes information about the project, character descriptions, a list of all chapters with links to the youtube videos and a false store where you could fake-buy the DVDs for the series.

        It's made in <b>vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript</b>.
