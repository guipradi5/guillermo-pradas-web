          <h2>Hi!</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Guillermo. I&apos;m a web developer and game designer based in Barcelona, Spain.
            <br /><br />
            I graduated in 2017 with a deegree in Multimedia Engineering in the &apos;Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya&apos; and I&apos;ve been in the web development industry for the last {experienceYearsString} years.
            <br /><br />
            I have been working various front-end jobs, touching a wide array of technologies, from basic html projects to state of the art Node frameworks.<br />
            I mainly specialize in these and UX/UI development. My 3 main frameworks are <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a> and <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">NextJs/React</a> for which <Link href="/web">I&apos;ve developed a good number of projects</Link>
            <br /><br /><br />
            Apart from web technologies I&apos;m a fierce lover of art in most of its forms.
            <br /><br />
            One of my highest passions is learning and doing my own works of art. I&apos;ve done music, digital art, stories and videogames. The last one being my main focus at the moment.
            <br /><br />
            I&apos;ve been into game development since 2013, mostly learning its technical intricacies and trying bring some ideas to fruition. I&apos;ve only done little unpolished things. But my plan is to start releasing full products starting in 2024.<br />
            My game engine of choice is <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> with which I&apos;m developing 3 games at the moment (&apos;Gamu&apos;/Horror, &apos;Rosaly&apos;/Visual Novel and &apos;Ocean.OS&apos;/Adventure).<br />
            Other engines I&apos;m familiar with are <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> and <a href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/" target="_blank">RPG Maker</a>
            <br /><br />
            I do some music production from time to time under the name <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thelimbodrums" target="_blank">&apos;the.limbo.drums&apos;</a> with my friend Landric. At the moment we&apos;re in the works of releasing our first EP.
            <br /><br />
            In art, I&apos;ve done <a href="https://gillpradas.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">some illustrations</a>. But I haven&apos;t been active in the last number of years.
            <br /><br />
